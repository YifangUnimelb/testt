    "text": "Abstract. This paper forecasts Australian inflation and interest rate using Bayesian Vector Regressive Model with stochastic volatility and a multivariate-t distributed error, with the purpose of allowing time varying volatility and capturing sudden increases in volatility during extreme period such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It is an application of such method, which is often considered as a significant improvement over a standard BVAR, to Australian macroeconomic variables to generate spot and density forecasts using post-COVID data."

Note the former 4 variables all display a clear growth trend. Unemployment and cash rate are generally decreasing with fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe log level of CPI, real GDP, M1 and M3 aggregate were plotted here."

    "text": "ACF and PACF\nThe following ACF plots of all transformed variables show autocorrelation over a large number of lags, therefore, likely to be non-stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn PACF plots, significant correlations were only observed in the first lag for variables except for unemployment rate. It demonstrates partial autocorrelation for the first and second lag, also in some lags order 15 to 20."
