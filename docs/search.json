    "text": "Abstract. This paper forecasts Australian inflation and interest rate using Bayesian Vector Regressive Model with Stochastic Volatility and a multivariate-t distributed error, with the purpose of allowing time varying volatility and capturing sudden increase in volatility during extreme period such as COVID-19.It is an application of such method, which is suggested as a significant improvement over a standard BVAR, to the Australian macroeconomic variables to generate spot and density forecast using post-COVID data."

Note the former 4 variables all display a clear growth trend. Unemployment and cash rate are generally decreasing with noticable fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 400 times log difference of CPI, real GDP, M1 and M3 aggregate were plotted here. They seem stationary around a fixed mean. This will be tested later."
